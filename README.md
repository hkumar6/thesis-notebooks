# Bifurcations on and Symmetrization of Digraphs

A collection of jupyter notebooks and other scripts as supplement for my master thesis with the same title.

## Python package
[net_sym](https://github.com/hkumar6/thesis-notebooks/blob/master/net_sym/net_sym/net_sym.py) : Network symmetrization toolbox containing a set of useful functions for the symmetrization algorithm.

### Installing **net_sym**

The easiest way to install the package is to clone the repository and use pip3 on the local project folder.
```
git clone https://github.com/hkumar6/thesis-notebooks.git
pip3 install -e thesis-notebooks/net_sym
```

The following notebooks are dependent on this package.

## Bifurcations

* [Normal forms for bifurcations on SC digraphs (Section 2.3)](https://github.com/hkumar6/thesis-notebooks/blob/master/normal_forms_consensus.ipynb)
* [Dynamics on an in-tree and the proposed modification (Section 2.4)](https://github.com/hkumar6/thesis-notebooks/blob/master/conjecture.ipynb)

## Fast-slow systems

* [Dynamic bifurcation on SC digraphs (Section 3.4)](https://github.com/hkumar6/thesis-notebooks/blob/master/dynamic_bifurcation.ipynb)
* [Relaxation oscillations on a 2-node digraph (Section 3.5)](https://github.com/hkumar6/thesis-notebooks/blob/master/fast_slow.m)
* [Relaxation oscillations on SC digraphs (Section 3.5)](https://github.com/hkumar6/thesis-notebooks/blob/master/fast_slow_connected.ipynb)
* [Canards on a 2-node digraph (Section 3.5)](https://github.com/hkumar6/thesis-notebooks/blob/master/canards.m)

## Symmetrization

* [Enumeration of digraphs (Section 4.5)](https://github.com/hkumar6/thesis-notebooks/blob/master/all_digraphs.py)
* [Producing figures for the symmetrization algorithm (Section 4.6)](https://github.com/hkumar6/thesis-notebooks/blob/master/sym_conjecture.py)
